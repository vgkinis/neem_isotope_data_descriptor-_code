# neem_isotope_data_descriptor_code
Python code used for the data processing of the NEEM high resolution water isotope record described in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-021-00916-9 and <https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.925552>
In the script `postprocess_pangaea_file.py` we include two auxiliary routines that can be used for simplifying the format of the data file for further use as well as for interpolating the data set on a constandt step time scale. More information can be found in the documentation strings of the `postprocess_pangaea_file.py` file.
